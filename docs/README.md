# How to generate documentation #
#################################

The flux-python-api documentation is generated with Sphinx, which is built
within this directory as part of the code repository and therefore requires
no installation on the client end.

The master documentation file is **index.rst** in this directory. This file
uses **reStructuredText** markup. Whenever changes are made to this file,
documentation needs to be rebuilt using these steps:

	$ cd ./docs
	$ make html

That's it.

Then you can access and view the documentation that was just generated by
going to this location in a web browser:

	file:///usr/local/project/flux-python-api/docs/_build/html/index.html

########################
# Using Sphinx's autodoc

Sphinx's [**autodoc**] (http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/autodoc.html) plug-in
automatically generates documentation from docstrings of methods within the
specific module. As of this writing, **autodoc** is used to document the
**models** and **mediators** modules. The following text is pasted directly
into the **index.rst**, e.g.:

	.. automodule:: fluxpy.models  
		:members:
		:show-inheritance:

Autodoc has it's own markup syntax allowing more fancy/customizable formatting
for method documentation. See examples [here](http://sphinx-doc.org/domains.html#info-field-lists)
